Light and Bartlein palettes come from the
[Department of Geography at the University of Oregon](http://geog.uoregon.edu/datagraphics/color_scales.htm).
They come in two sub-modules grouped by their use:

- [`palettable.lightbartlein.diverging`][diverging]
- [`palettable.lightbartlein.sequential`][sequential]
